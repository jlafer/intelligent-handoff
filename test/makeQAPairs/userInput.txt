Agent: Hello, this is Tammy with Owl Shoes. How may I help you today?
Customer: Hi, this is Sarah. I saw some tennis shoes on your website but I have a couple questions.
Agent: Well, thanks for visiting our website Tammy. I'm happy to assist you. What's your question?
Customer: Okay, there is a picture of the Endurance model in a pink color but the dropdown menu doesn't include pink. So do you have those shoes in pink?
Agent: Let me check on that. Please hold on for a second. Yes, Tammy, we carry those in pink but we call that color 'rose' for some reason. You should see that in the dropdown menu.
Customer: Oh yes, I see that. Alright, than answers that.
Agent: Did you have a second question?
Customer: Yes, for that same model, do you carry them in a size 11 for women?
Agent: Yes, we do. Owl Shoes carries all women's shoes in sizs 6 through 12.
Customer: Great! Thanks you. That's all I needed.
Agent: Well, thanks for calling and if you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out.
Customer: Will do. Goodbye.
Agent: Goodbye.
